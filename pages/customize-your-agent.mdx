# Customize Your Agent

## Agent Configuration

Create your agent configuration file in the `config/agents/` directory. You can use the provided `default.agent.json` as a template or create your own:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Agent name",
  "bio": "Your AI Agent Bio",
  "lore": [
    "Some lore of your AI Agent 1",
    "Some lore of your AI Agent 2"
  ],
  "objectif": [
    "first objectif that your AI Agent need to follow",
    "second objectif that your AI Agent need to follow"
  ],
  "knowledge": [
    "first knowledge of your AI Agent",
    "second knowledge of your AI Agent"
  ],
  "interval": "Your agent interval between each transaction in ms",
  "chat_id": "Your Agent Chat-id",
  "external_client": [
    "first external_client",
    "second external_client"
  ],
  "allowed_external_client_tools": [
    "first allowed_external_client_tools",
    "second allowed_external_client_tools"
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Fields Explained

Below is a list of fields for defining an agent:

| Field                         | Description |
|--------------------------------|------------|
| `name`                         | Your agent's identifier. |
| `bio`                          | A brief description of your agent's purpose. |
| `lore`                         | Background information that defines your agent's character. |
| `objectif`                     | A list of tasks and goals your agent should accomplish. |
| `knowledge`                    | Areas of expertise your agent should have. |
| `interval`                     | Time between actions (in milliseconds) for autonomous mode. |
| `chat_id`                      | Unique identifier for chat sessions. |
| `external_client`              | List of external platforms (e.g., 'discord', 'twitter'). |
| `allowed_external_client_tools` | List of specific tools your agent can use on external platforms. |

## Transaction Limits

Set up transaction limits in the `config/limit/config-limit.json` file to control your agent's spending:

```json
{
  "transfer_limit": [
    {
      "symbol": "ETH",
      "amount": "0.000001"
    },
    {
      "symbol": "STRK",
      "amount": "2"
    }
  ]
}
```

The agent will check these limits before executing any transfers. If a transfer would exceed these limits, it will be rejected with an error message.

## Social Media Integration

### Environment Setup

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Twitter Configuration
# Choose authentication mode - must be either "API" or "CREDIDENTIALS"
TWITTER_AUTH_MODE="YOUR_TWITTER_CONFIGURATION_MODE"

# If using API mode, fill these:
TWITTER_API="YOUR_TWITTER_API"
TWITTER_API_SECRET="YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"

# If using CREDENTIALS mode, fill these:
TWITTER_USERNAME="YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME"
TWITTER_PASSWORD="YOUR_TWITTER_PASSWORD"
TWITTER_EMAIL="YOUR_TWITTER_EMAIL"

# Discord Configuration (Optional)
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID="YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID"
```

## Running Your Agent

1. Ensure all configurations are in place.
2. Start the agent by specifying your config file:

   ```bash
   pnpm run local --agent=your-config-file.json
   ```

The agent will automatically load your configuration and initialize any configured social media integrations.
