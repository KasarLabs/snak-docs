# Create Your First Agent

Deploy your own Starknet agent in minutes! This guide will walk you through setting up and running your first agent, whether you want it to operate autonomously or interact through chat.

[VIDEO PLACEHOLDER]

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create and deploy your first Starknet agent:

<Steps>

### 1. Environment Setup

First, create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```dotenv
# Starknet configuration (mandatory)
STARKNET_PUBLIC_ADDRESS="YOUR_STARKNET_PUBLIC_ADDRESS"
STARKNET_PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_STARKNET_PRIVATE_KEY"
STARKNET_RPC_URL="YOUR_STARKNET_RPC_URL"

# AI Provider configuration (mandatory)
AI_PROVIDER_API_KEY="YOUR_AI_PROVIDER_API_KEY"
AI_MODEL="YOUR_AI_MODEL"
AI_PROVIDER="YOUR_AI_PROVIDER"

# NestJS server configuration
SERVER_API_KEY="YOUR_SERVER_API_KEY"
SERVER_PORT="YOUR_SERVER_PORT"

# Agent additional configuration
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN?="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID?="YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID"
```

You can retrieve the above values the following way:

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STARKNET_PUBLIC_ADDRESS`      | Your Starknet wallet address (from [Argent X](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Braavos](https://braavos.app/)) |
| `STARKNET_PRIVATE_KEY`         | Your wallet's private key (export from wallet settings)                                                    |
| `STARKNET_RPC_URL`             | Endpoint from an [RPC provider](https://docs.starknet.io/tools/fullnodes-rpc-providers/#rpc_providers)     |
| `AI_PROVIDER_API_KEY` | API key from your chosen provider (e.g., [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started))   |
| `AI_PROVIDER`         | Model provider name (e.g., "anthropic")                                                                    |
| `AI_MODEL`            | Specific model identifier (e.g., "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")                                               |

<Callout type="warning">
  Never commit your private keys or API keys to version control. Make sure to
  add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
</Callout>

### 2. Agent Configuration

Your agent's personality and capabilities can be configured in the `./config/agents` directory. You can either:

- Use a pre-built template
- Create a custom configuration

<Callout type="info">
  For detailed configuration options, check out our [Agent Customization
  Guide](/customize-your-agent).
</Callout>

For this tutorial, we'll use the default configuration to get started quickly.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required packages using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Launch Your Agent

Start your agent by running:

```bash
pnpm run local
```

You'll be prompted to choose between two operation modes:

- **Chat Mode**: Interact with your agent through a command-line interface
- **Autonomous Mode**: Let your agent operate independently based on its configuration

</Steps>
